# Design and Analysis of Compilers Course Project

This repository contains the source code and documentation for our group project in the Design and Analysis of Compilers course at Ain Shams University.

## Project Description

Our project aims to develop a compiler for a programming language. The compiler will implement various stages of the compilation process such as:

- Lexical analysis
- Parsing
- Semantic analysis (Future work)
- Code generation (Future work)

We will also include a test suite to ensure the correctness of our compiler.
